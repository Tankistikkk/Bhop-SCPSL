# Bhop_SCPSL
Bhop SCPSL was created solely to simplify the game, not to harm other projects, etc. In addition, if I'm not mistaken, it seems to be banned in many projects, but I'm not sure. It's better to check for yourself. In addition, Bhop itself is designed in such a way that it can work not only in SCPSL, but also in other games as well.
